MOST IMPORTANT

Todoist (a todo application is not neccessary, it is just an idea on a way to integrate it with an app on the phone.)  google tasks, keep, or some other task system or even a mySQL connection. I don't really care. but the concept is that tasks are updated and can be reviewed on another platform.

this is my first application that I think I have ever published on Github and my first attempt.  

this is a tool I want to build for me. but I think other people might find it useful.  I just can't get my thoughts into python.

much of this code has been created using chatgpt and I have tried co-pilot unsuccessfully.


# TodoADHD
This is a todo list and task manager for people that have trouble focusing or have ADD or ADHD


Suggestions made by Chat GPT for improvement: 

# Refactoring and Modularization Suggestions

## 1. Split Large Classes into Smaller Ones
- **Task Management**: Separate class for handling task-related functionalities.
- **Todoist Integration**: `TodoistManager` class for Todoist specific functions.
- **Timer Functionality**: `Timer` class for all timer-related operations.

## 2. Modularize Functionalities into Methods
- Break down large methods into smaller, focused methods.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

## 3. Use Utility Functions
- Create utility functions for repetitive code blocks.
- Utility functions for common UI patterns.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Logging
- Centralize error handling and logging.
- Standardize API call error handling.

## 5. Event Handling and Callbacks
- Organize complex event handling into separate methods or classes.

## 6. Configuration Management
- Use a `Config` class or module for managing configuration settings.

## 7. Improve Code Reusability
- Refactor repeated code patterns into reusable methods or classes.

## 8. UI Layout and Design
- Consider a `UILayout` class for managing complex UI layouts.

## 9. Testing
- Implement unit tests for various components.

## 10. Documentation
- Update or add documentation to reflect code structure changes.

## Suggestions for Further Refinement

### Initialization of Tkinter Variables
- **Move the initialization of Tkinter variables** like `self.reminder_interval` and `self.file_path_var` to the `create_widgets` method, if they are only related to UI elements.

### Dynamic Widget Configurations
- It's normal to have **dynamic configurations** (like enabling/disabling buttons) outside of `create_widgets`. However, ensure that their initial setup is within `create_widgets`.

### Review `self.tasks_listbox` and `self.pause_button` Usage
- Check if the **initial setup** of these widgets is inside `create_widgets`. Their subsequent modifications (like inserting items into `self.tasks_listbox` or changing the state of `self.pause_button`) due to events or interactions can remain outside.

### Completion Window
- If the **completion window** (`self.completion_window`) is a significant part of the UI, consider whether its setup can be modularized or initially defined within `create_widgets`, with a method to open it when needed.

### Consistent Commenting and Documentation
- Continue to use **clear comments and documentation**, especially in `create_widgets`, to describe the purpose and layout of the UI components.

### Refactor and Modularize
- If possible, **refactor large methods or sections** dealing with specific functionality into smaller methods or even separate classes for better maintainability.
